            <p class="quote-desc">This line reflects Yennefer's sharp wit and her ability to see the humor in challenging situations. It could be said during one of her interactions with the Skelligers, perhaps when dealing with their unyielding personalities or traditions. Skelligers are renowned for their resilience and pride, qualities mirrored in the harsh, stormy environment of their islands.</p>

                <p class="para1">Geralt arrives in the Isles of Skellige after surviving a shipwreck caused by raiders and reaches Kaer Trolde during King Bran Tuirseach's funeral. At the wake, he reunites with Yennefer and Crach an Craite, who leads the an Craite clan. Yennefer enlists Geralt's help to steal a magical mask from the druid's laboratory, an artifact that reveals visions of the past. Using it, they learn Ciri was pursued by the Wild Hunt and that the village of Lofoten was recently attacked.</p>
                <p class="para2">The villagers tell Geralt and Yennefer about Craven, a man who fled during the Wild Hunt’s attack and later went to a sacred garden to kill a werewolf. Unfortunately, Craven died in the attempt. Undeterred, Yennefer uses necromancy to temporarily reanimate his corpse, forcing it to recount the events leading up to his death and provide vital information about Ciri's fate.</p>

                <h3>Skjall's Story and Ciri's Escape</h3>
                <p>Through necromancy, Yennefer and Geralt learn that the corpse, Skjall, was a young man who once helped Ciri. He brought her and the masked elf to his village after they mysteriously fell from the sky. While recovering from her injuries, Ciri received instructions from the masked elf about a meeting place. Skjall aided her escape when the Wild Hunt arrived but was knocked unconscious after witnessing the elf take Ciri away on a boat. When he awoke, the boat had returned, carrying only a shrunken, disfigured humanoid resembling Uma, the misshapen figure Geralt once saw in Velen.</p>

                <h3>Events in Skellige</h3>
                <p>The information about Uma provides a lead, but Geralt has other matters to address in Skellige. He can rekindle his romance with Yennefer by helping her capture a djinn to break the bond of fate tying them together. Additionally, Geralt can assist in determining Skellige's next ruler by supporting one of the an Craite children for the throne. Once his business in Skellige is concluded, Geralt departs to retrieve Uma in Velen.</p>

                <h3>Uma and Nilfgaard's Demands</h3>
                <p>Geralt successfully retrieves Uma and begins the journey back to Kaer Morhen. However, Nilfgaardian troops intercept him, delivering a summons from Emperor Emhyr. In Vizima, Geralt and Yennefer explain their findings to the Emperor and theorize that Uma is cursed, requiring Kaer Morhen’s resources to lift it. Although the Emperor remains unimpressed, he reluctantly allows them to continue their work.</p>
