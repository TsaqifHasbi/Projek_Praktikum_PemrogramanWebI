                <p class="para1">In the city of Novigrad, the influence of the Church of the Eternal Fire grows, leading to the persecution of anyone deemed "other," such as non-humans, mages, and witchers. Geralt navigates this hostile environment while searching for clues about Ciri and his old friend, Triss Merigold, who is in hiding and struggling to make ends meet. After helping Triss out of a difficult situation, she directs Geralt to Corinne Tilly, a dream seer, who reveals that Ciri had been in contact with Dandelion.</p>
                <p class="para2">With the information from Corinne, Geralt enlists the help of old friends like Zoltan Chivay and Sigismund Dijkstra, now a crime boss in Novigrad's underworld. Their search leads Geralt across the city, with Triss playing a key role in locating Dandelion, who is being held under the Eternal Fire's main temple. The investigation uncovers a web of intrigue, setting the stage for a deeper dive into the dark secrets of Novigrad.</p>
